# Housing Market Analysis

In this repository we analyze housing data from King County in Seattle. We produce a regression model for house price and investigate the factors that influence price.

## Business Problem 

For this project we identify our hypothetical stakeholder as King County Assessor [John Wilson](https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/assessor/About-Us/Assessors-Bio.aspx). We are asked to use data from house sales in King County occurring between May 2, 2014 and May 27, 2015 to produce a model for house prices. This model will be used by the assessor to validate the existing property taxation model. 

## Key Insights
In this section we briefly summarise our findings as they relate to the business problem.
